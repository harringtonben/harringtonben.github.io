          <p>Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.</p>

          <p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.</p>

          <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.</p>

          <p>I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>
